Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

Example:

Assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:

Line 10

方法1:
sed -n "10p" file.txt

方法2:
l10=`head -n 10 file.txt | wc -l`
if [ "$l10" = "10" ]; then
head -n 10 file.txt | tail -1
fi


方法3
cnt = 0
while read line
do
    cnt = $((cnt+1))
    if[$cnt -eq 10];
    then
        echo $line
        fi
done < file.txt

方法4:
cat file.txt | sed -n "10p"
