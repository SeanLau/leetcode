编写一个 SQL查询，来查找名为 Person 的表中的所有重复电子邮件。

示例：

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
根据以上输入，您的查询应返回以下结果：

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
注意： 所有电子邮件都是小写字母。

select Email from Person group by Email having count(Email) > 1;

SELECT Email FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
Having COUNT(Email)>1;

--Use self join.
 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
 FROM Person a JOIN Person b
 ON (a.Email = b.Email)
 WHERE a.Id <> b.Id

--Use subquery with EXISTS:
 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
 FROM Person a
 WHERE EXISTS(
     SELECT 1
     FROM Person b
     WHERE a.Email = b.Email
     LIMIT 1, 1


--Basic idea is this query:
 SELECT DISTINCT Email FROM Person
 MINUS(SELECT Id, Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email)
But since MySQL does not support MINUS, we use LEFT JOIN:

 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email FROM Person a
 LEFT JOIN (SELECT Id, Email from Person GROUP BY Email) b
 ON (a.email = b.email) AND (a.Id = b.Id)
 WHERE b.Email IS NULL
